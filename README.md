# Website-to-detect-Alzheimer-Disease-using-MRI-Scans

A website designed to detect Alzheimer's disease using MRI scans is an innovative and comprehensive platform that combines advanced medical imaging with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence. This website enables users, including healthcare professionals, researchers, and even patients, to upload their MRI scans securely. Once uploaded, the scans undergo rigorous analysis by sophisticated machine learning algorithms specifically trained to detect subtle biomarkers and structural changes in the brain indicative of Alzheimer's disease.

The platform features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring ease of navigation and accessibility for users of varying technical expertise. The AI algorithms analyze the MRI images, identifying critical patterns and anomalies such as amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and brain atrophy, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. The results are then presented in detailed reports, accompanied by visualizations that highlight the affected regions of the brain, making it easier for clinicians to interpret the findings.
